Aim: Learning to write a compiler for a simple language

The following folder contains the below-mentioned files:-
1. cucu.l
2. cucu.y
3. Sample1.cu
4. Sample2.cu
5. Lexer.txt
6. Parser.txt
7. cucu.tab.c
8. cucu.tab.h
9. lex.yy.c
10. cucu

To properly execute the files, use command:-
1. flex cucu.l
2. bison -d cucu.y
3. gcc lex.yy.c cucu.tab.c -o cucu -lfl

Also, there can be an issue of file endings converted from Unix to Windows, so for that, run command:
1. dos2unix {required_file}  ( For e.g: dos2unix Sample1.cu)

The compiler supports:
-> The function supports variable declarations, function declarations, and function definitions.
-> Variable declaration can be:-
   int a;
   int a=5;
   char *s;
   char *s="parth";
-> Function declaration can be:-
   int main(int a,int b, char*s, int c,char *t);
-> Function definitions can be:-
   int main(int a,int b, char*s, int c,char *t){
       int a;
       char *s;
       int b = 2 + 3 * 5 + 5 / 3 + 3 - 5;
       char *t = "parth";
       b = 2 + 3 * 5 + 5 / 3 + 3 - 5;
       t = "parth";
       s[i] = 4 + 3 * 4;
       lt(a,b,c,d);
       if(a==0){
           a=1;
       }
       else{
           a=0;
       }
       while(a!=0){
           b=0;
           a=a-1;
       return 0;
   }
-> The compiler follows the precedence order and also the associativity rules.
-> The compiler supports all the operations mentioned in the assignment
-> It also ignores the single and multi-line comments.
-> The lexer shows all the lexical errors in the Lexer.txt while the parser will break down on the 
first error it encounters in the grammar rules. It will display the first time it breaks in the Parser.txt
-> In Lexer.txt: error will be of the form: "Line number 8: Lexical error, there is an undefined token in input: @"
-> In Parser.txt: error will be of the form: "error: syntax error"

In Sample1.cu, I have included two lexical errors and in Sample2.cu, I have included one syntax error at the end of the program.
The compiler will display lexical errors in Lexer.txt and the first syntax error at which it breaks in the Parser.txt
